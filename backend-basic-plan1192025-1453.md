Based on the frontend codebase, here's a high-level feature plan for the backend:

1. **Post Management**
   - CRUD operations for posts
   - Support for attachments/images
   - Category and tag filtering
   - Upvote/downvote functionality

2. **Content Organization**
   - Categories (Immigration, Fire Alerts, General)
   - Tag system
   - Saved posts functionality

3. **Basic Infrastructure**
   - Express server setup
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Route organization
   - Error handling middleware

4. **Future Considerations**
   - User authentication (for saved posts)
   - File upload handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Caching layer

This aligns with the frontend components we see (PostList, CreatePostForm, SavedPosts) while keeping implementation details flexible. Would you like to start with any particular area?
