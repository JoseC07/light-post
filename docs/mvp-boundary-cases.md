# MVP Boundary Cases & Scope Management

## Core Feature Boundaries

### Post Management Boundaries

#### Create Post Essentials vs. Enhancements
**MVP Scope**

- Tag suggestions/autocomplete
- Draft saving
- Post templates
- Scheduled posting

#### Content Limitations
**MVP Scope**
- Title: 100 characters
- Content: 5000 characters
- Tags: 5 maximum
- Attachments: 1 file, 5MB max

**Future Considerations**
- Extended character limits
- Multiple file attachments
- Custom formatting
- Embedded media support

### User Interaction Boundaries

#### Authentication & Authorization
**MVP Scope**
- Basic email/password login
- Simple role system (user/admin)
- Basic post ownership

**Out of Scope**

- Role-based permissions
- User profiles
- Activity history
- User reputation system

#### Voting System
**MVP Scope**
- Simple upvote/downvote
- Basic vote counting
- One vote per user per post

**Future Enhancements**
- Vote weight based on user reputation
- Vote history tracking
- Vote analytics
- Comment voting

## Technical Boundaries

### Performance Constraints
**MVP Acceptable Limits**
- Page load: < 3 seconds
- API response: < 1 second

- Image resolution: 1920x1080 max
- Database size: 1GB initial allocation

**Future Considerations**
- CDN integration
- Archive system for old posts
- Backup retention policy
- Storage scaling strategy

## Development Guidelines

### MVP Feature Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Is this feature essential for core functionality?
- [ ] Does it solve an immediate user need?
- [ ] Can we simplify the implementation?
- [ ] Will it significantly impact development timeline?
- [ ] Is it required for basic user experience?

### Scope Creep Prevention
1. **Feature Request Protocol**
   - Document enhancement requests
   - Assess impact on MVP timeline
   - Categorize as MVP/Post-MVP
   - Track in separate backlog

2. **Implementation Boundaries**
   - Stick to simple, proven solutions
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Focus on core user stories
   - Minimize external dependencies

3. **Technical Debt Awareness**
   - Document intentional limitations
   - Plan for future refactoring
   - Maintain clean architecture
   - Keep upgrade paths open

## Risk Management

### MVP Risks to Monitor
1. **Feature Creep Indicators**
   - Increasing complexity in simple features
   - Growing dependency list
   - Expanding scope discussions
   - Rising technical debt

2. **Resource Allocation Warnings**
   - Development time on non-core features
   - Increasing infrastructure costs
   - Growing maintenance overhead
   - Feature parity discussions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Regular Scope Reviews**
   - Weekly MVP alignment checks
   - Feature priority reassessment
   - Timeline impact analysis
   - Resource allocation review

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Keep feature parking lot updated
   - Document rejected features
   - Maintain clear MVP boundaries
   - Track technical decisions
