## Key Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Features
1. Post Management (In Progress)
   - CRUD operations
   - Basic validation
   - File attachments

2. User Authentication (Next)
   - Email/password authentication
   - Basic role system
   - Session management

3. Content Organization
   - Categories
   - Tags
   - Basic search

## Development Guidelines

### MVP Scope Rules
1. Must support core user stories
2. Implement simplest working solution
3. Avoid premature optimization
4. Focus on stability over features

### Feature Acceptance Criteria
- Meets MVP requirements
- Passes security checks
- Has test coverage
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met

## Edge Case Management

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical** - Must handle in MVP
   - Data loss prevention
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Core functionality breaks

2. **Important** - Should handle in MVP
   - User experience impacts
   - Performance issues
   - Data consistency

3. **Future** - Post-MVP consideration
   - Edge user scenarios
   - Advanced features
   - Optimization cases

## Technical Boundaries

### MVP Limitations
- Single file attachment per post
- Basic text content only
- Simple role system
- Limited API endpoints

### Performance Targets
- Page load: < 3s
- API response: < 1s
- Max file size: 5MB
- Max posts/page: 10

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete post CRUD operations
2. Implement basic auth system
3. Setup testing infrastructure

### Short-term Goals
1. MVP feature completion
2. Basic security implementation
3. Initial deployment setup

### Documentation Tasks
1. API documentation
2. User guides
3. Deployment guides
