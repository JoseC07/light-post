## Technical Edge Cases

### Database

   - Error state handling
   - Cache invalidation

## Security Edge Cases

### Authentication

   - Rate limiting

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - User feedback
   - Error logging
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Load testing
   - Security testing
